# Nested sessions

How to **use** a session stack. Pair with [memnet-use](../memnet-use/SKILL.md). Doctrine: MemNet `docs/extras/memnet-session-strata.md`. SysML loop: MemNet `docs/application-notes/system/llm-sysml-v2-modeling.md`. Evidence (MemNet checkout): `sysml-models/outputs/sysml-session-nest-cuts-case-study.md` (Turns A-I).

Chat is never SSOT. Goldfish is **one** S per generate. Do not revive Layer / `layer=`. **Package and PyPI 0.19.3**. Extra **0.15** catalog Snap is shipped.

## Two laws

| # | Law |
|---|-----|
| 1 | **Relatives of one cue** -- complete Shape of **this** parent, then one brace at `SYM.line`. |
| 2 | **Sub-unit in a separate session** -- over M, or **already built**, is cut away. Parent shell: **name** + `session=`. Do not walk that other S in this generate. |

Look = `pin_map` with MCP arg **`session=`** that id (catalog pins also carry locator `session=`). Join = `import_slice` of a **neighbourhood**, not a second Snap and not a paste of the nested tree.

## Look loop (session in session)

```text
pin_map(S_cat)     -> pick session=
pin_map(session=S_i) -> child has session=?  yes -> drop map, next generate pin_map(S_child)
                   -> ... until this brace fits M whole
edit SSOT of THAT cut -> re-Snap THAT interior (reuse session= if qname= already has one)
```

Not N maps stacked in one prompt.

Mint the stack with **`snap_model`** (catalog + interiors) or Path-B **`ingest_*`** into **one** current session (1->1 -- that is not catalog Snap). The stack stays live (look is one S per generate). Default cap **1024** (`MEMNET_MAX_SESSIONS`). `session_list` emits `@STAT: sessions|n/max`; `session_close` that id (does not dump S) when a stratum is finished so later Snap can mint.

## Already built

If the nested type already presents in another minted session: **present** it. Shell = usage name + `typedBy` + existing `session=`. Configuration **delta** (`subsets`, extra nested pin) stays on the usage. Do not Snap a twin of the same `qname=`.

## Parallel sub-units

When the **parent shell is already clear** in SSOT (children named, `session=` assigned): parent mints one `TSK_*` per interior, passes that session id, **ends the turn**. Workers goldfish **only** their S_i -- load [memnet-multitask](../memnet-multitask/SKILL.md) (TCP/HTTP). If the parent nest is still being invented: **serial** -- write the shell first. Same interior / same brace: RSV or serialise.

## MUST NOT

- Kind zoo (`S_part`, `S_req`, `S_port`) -- cuts are **fit**, not construct names.
- One session per leaf / exploded multiplicity.
- Clip `max_rows` and call it Shape -- refuse; cut sessions.
- Absorb a whole S / merge interiors in chat.
- Two workers on the same interior before the shell is named.
